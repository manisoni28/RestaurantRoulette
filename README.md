RestaurantRoulette
==================

Can't decide where to eat? No problem. Restaurant Roulette is an Android app that randomly picks a restaurant for you from your list of favourites, taking all the annoying guesswork and decision making out of choosing where to eat.

Restaurant Roulette allows you to enter all your favourite restaurants, and will pick one for you for all those times you just can't decide on your own. In the mood for a specific genre? No problem - you can filter on that. It'll even search Google Maps and show you how exactly how to get there. You can also view your history of recommendations, to remember exactly where you ate on a given date.
